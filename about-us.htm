Introducing 'the Photowale' a step taken to seize those moments in every person's life be it a wedding. After a short stint in the hospitality industry "the photowale" now looks to explore further And is ready to click and capture!"</p>
                        <p>"My team, Sanket and Tejas both were in the Elphinstone College doing bachelorette in IT way back in 2009. As a passion they used to assist their role model. Sanket used to assist to his uncle Mr. Datta Berde and Tejas to his father Mr. Nishikant Rane.
  Along with photography, Tejas has got 'Visharad' in playing Tabla. After being graduated, he started working as a professional animator and still he is doing the best in it. 
  Sanket then completed his Post Graduation and started working in IT company as a Web Developer.
                         Both had their perspection to develop their skills in what they are meant to be. They had done many assignments together before I was introduced and decided to take this step ahead of being  professionals in this area."</p>
                            <p>This is how I came into the picture, <span>"thePhotowale"</span>.
   We have been photographing people, nature, food, industry since 2011 as an in individual. So, as "thePhotowale", we will be working together as a team.</p>
